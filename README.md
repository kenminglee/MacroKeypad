# MacroKeypad Tutorial (In Progress)
##### An in depth tutorial on how to make a custom built macro keypad from scratch using an Arduino Uno

### Introduction
#### What is a Macro Keypad?
To put it simply, it is an array of key switches that executes a list of commands on key press.
An example would be pressing a single key to cut and paste, instead of having to press Ctrl+X or Ctrl+V 

#### What can I use it for?
Here are some really cool real-life applications:

* Want to open a specific file/program with a single click? You can do that with a macro keypad
* Want to have a very complicated password that you dont have to remember? With a macro keypad, you can assign one key (or more!) to         input your passwords for you! Press one key, and there you go - your entire password typed out for you!
* Completely plug and play! No need for any softwares to slow down your computer, and you can use it on any device (with a usb port)!

#### Why make your own custom macro keypad?
* Its **fully customizable** !! You literally choose how many keys you want to have, what colour, what type of switches, whether you want full RGB or not etc etc - you get the point
* Its significantly **cheaper**. Store-bought macro keypads are expensive, have unecessary flairs (aluminum body and whatnot), and at the end of the day, DIY-ing your own macro keypad will save your wallet.
* Most importantly, its **FUN**, and you actually get to **Learn Stuffs**. Personally, I have had a lot of fun building and troubleshooting the macro keypad, and I even get to learn valuable skills like soldering, some simple programming, and some basic electronics (how to configure a switch, pull-up pull-down etc)
